    <section>
        <p>Hello, I am a passionate and dedicated Ph.D. student in computer science, with a specialized focus on computational creativity applied to the dynamic realm of video games. My academic journey has led me to delve deep into the intersection of technology and creativity, seeking innovative ways to enhance the gaming experience through advanced computational approaches.</p>

        <p>My enthusiasm for video games extends beyond the research realm, as I am an avid gamer who appreciates the artistry and technology behind virtual worlds. In addition to my love for gaming, I have a keen interest in photography, exploring the visual and creative aspects of capturing moments through a lens.</p>

        <p>I earned my master's degree in Mexico, where I concentrated on machine learning techniques applied to user segmentation. This academic achievement not only provided me with a solid foundation in cutting-edge technologies but also fueled my passion for utilizing computational methods to address real-world challenges.</p>

        <p>As I embark on the journey of pursuing a Ph.D., I am excited to contribute to the evolving field of computational creativity. My research is focused on the possibility of generating DLC content for video games. The emphasis of the research lies in developing new mechanics that enhance the playability of the original map. Additionally, the creation of new enemies and map areas will benefit from the newly generated mechanics.</p>
